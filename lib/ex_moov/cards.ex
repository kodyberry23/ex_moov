  You can link credit or debit cards to Moov accounts. You can use a card as a source for making transfers, which charges the card. To link a card to a Moov account
  and avoid some of the burden of PCI compliance, use the card link Moov Drop. You cannot add a card via the Dashboard. If youâ€™re linking a card via API, you must provide
  Moov with a copy of your PCI attestation of compliance. When testing cards, use the designated card numbers for test mode. You must contact Moov before going live in production with cards.
  Read Moov's guide on cards for more information.
